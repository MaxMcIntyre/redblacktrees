This was part of my CS126 coursework during my first year at Warwick. It consisted of implementing any Data Structure I thought was right to store the Users, Weets, and Follower relationships for the Twitter clone known as 'Witter'.

The code I wrote is all in FollowerStore.java, UserStore.java and WeetStore.java. My assignment was to write the methods based upon a given specification for what they should take as arguments and return as output.

The code can be run and tested using the run_script_unix.sh file.
